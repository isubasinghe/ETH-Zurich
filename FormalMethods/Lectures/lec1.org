* Expression evaluation
** In mathematics e.g. f(x,y) = x - y. Compute f(5,7) by substituting 5 and 7.
** Same applies for Haskell:
*** gcd 10 15 = gcd 10 (15-10) case 3 otherwise
***           = gcd 10 5
* Evaluation strategeties
** Eager evaluation: evaluate arguments first
*** Also called "call by value"
*** Corresponds to left path in picture
** Lazy evaluation: evaluate arguments only when needed (Haskell)
*** Also called "call-by-need" or "left-most/outermost"
*** Certain functions force evaluation, e.g. arithmetic.
